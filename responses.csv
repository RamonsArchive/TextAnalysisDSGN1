I’d hate to have to crawl under it or catapult over it, especially when I really need to get to the toilet. Having it pull up into the ceiling or disappear into the floor seems ‘extra’.",Yeah.

",FALSE,Only if the door lock is broken I would abstain.,"Seems like a design oversight and frankly weird, it would not be that hard to extend the stall walls so that they cover everything and fill the gaps. If it is a ventilation issue they can just provide one to every stall. ","Security and privacy, I should not be able to see people walking around outside and they should not have to wonder if a stall is occupied or not. When I need to use a stall I often bend down to check under the stalls just to make sure that the stall I'm going towards does not have an occupant (which is also weird since you're looking at some random person's hairy legs while they have a shit). ","I would add a mechanism that displays whether a stall is occupied or not using green and red indicators, which would help prevent and awkward encounters of people try to use stalls that are already occupied. I would also fill in the gaps in the wall as I think it's very weird I can see out of the stall and other people can peer in at me as well.",?
